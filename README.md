# TextViewWidth
 
Text View Width is a Glyphs app palette plugin that allows to set the Text View width relative to the width of a given glyph (20 times width of glyph H, for example). This means that the line breaks will appear about the same for all masters. The plugin dynamically updates the width.

## Usage

The plugin uses the following format of the input: '20 H' or '15 space' etc., which means 20 times width of glyph H or 15 times the width of the space glyph.

You can also set the width in units (the same way as you do in Glyphs preferences), in this case simply insert a number.
To turn the plugin off, leave the input empty.


## Known issues

When you change masters, for a second you see an extra frame before it applies the new width. Which is of course annoying, WIP.
